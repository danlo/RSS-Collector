The goal of this project is to store stats and other informational messages in a redis (lossable data) which can be later provided as an RSS feed.

This would provide a simplier "lossable" way of communication among the team and provide the system with a way to talk to developers... sort of.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
  node.js 2.5
  redis
